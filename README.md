# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains **different sets of machine learning projects**, each stored in its own folder.

- ðŸ“‚ **.ipynb files** â€“ Jupyter Notebook files containing the machine learning code, explanations, and workflow.
- ðŸ“‚ **.csv files** â€“ Dataset files used for training, testing, and validating the models.

Each folder is an independent project with its own dataset and notebook implementation.  
Feel free to explore each project separately to understand the data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and insights.
